# CSE30124-CatanProject
This repository will hold the code for my Catan AI Helper for my final project in Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. 

## FrontEnd: Angular 
In the catan-helper/src/app folder you will see all of the important front end files. The board folder holds the code for the landing page that allows the user to input their board data. Then contorl is then redirected to the chat component. Here is where the user is presented with their options for explaratory data analysis. 

## Angular Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.


## Backend: Flask (app.py !!)
In the catanAPI folder, the most important document is app.py. Here is where you go to look for the code that empowers the AI system. The folder catanAPI/EDA holds python scripts that I used to test and develop code for the app.py flask routes and to perform some explaratory data analysis. These files are not truly important, and most of them won't run (because they were for testing).

## Flask server
In a separate terminal, run 'flask run' from the catanAPI folder, and then you can navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
